My name is Faren White. I was born on September 3, 1998. I currently live in Madison, MS. I recently graduated from Germantown High School in Gluckstadt, MS. I plan to further my education at the PRESTIGIOUS Tougaloo College, where I will major in Chemistry and minor in Biology. I will one day become either a pediatric dentist or a pediatric general surgeon.
